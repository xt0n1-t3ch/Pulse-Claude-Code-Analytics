# Pulse update checks

Pulse checks GitHub Releases from the Tauri backend and shows a small in-app popup when a newer stable release is available.

## Runtime flow

1. `check_app_update()` calls the GitHub latest-release API for `xt0n1-t3ch/Pulse-Claude-Code-Analytics`.
2. The backend compares the release tag against `env!("CARGO_PKG_VERSION")`.
3. Drafts and prereleases are ignored.
4. `UpdateBanner.svelte` renders `New Update Available` with current version, latest version, release title, release notes, and actions.
5. Before rendering an install action, the banner asks Tauri's updater for a signed update that supports the current platform.
6. When that preflight succeeds, **Update** downloads and installs through the same verified handle, then the process plugin relaunches Pulse.
7. When updater metadata is missing, invalid, or unavailable for the platform, the banner offers **Open release** instead of an install action.

The popup checks at startup and then every 6 hours. Settings exposes a manual **Check for updates** action by dispatching `pulse:check-updates`.

## User controls

- **Later** hides the current popup until the next check.
- **Skip version** stores the latest version in `localStorage` and suppresses that release during automatic checks.
- **Update** appears only for a preflighted signed update and is the approval checkpoint for download, install, and relaunch.
- **Open release** appears when in-app installation is unavailable and opens the allowlisted GitHub release page.

## Signed updater boundary

Release discovery is informational; the Tauri updater configuration and signature verification remain authoritative for installation. The UI never treats a GitHub release response as install proof, never offers **Update** without a platform-specific signed manifest, and installs through the same handle that passed preflight. Relaunch occurs only after the signed updater reports success. Download, install, or relaunch failures stay in the popup as retryable errors.
