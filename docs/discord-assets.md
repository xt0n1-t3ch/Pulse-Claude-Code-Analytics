# Discord Rich Presence assets

Discord **only reliably renders Rich Presence images that live in the app's
Developer Portal**. Plain `https://...` URLs get silently dropped by most
Discord client versions. If your Pulse install shows `Claude Code` in your
Discord status but no logo, this is the fix.

## Background

Before schema v3, the default config pointed `large_image_key` at a raw
GitHub URL that was never actually committed to `origin/main`, so Discord
resolved it to a 404 and showed nothing. Schema v3 changed the default to the
asset key `"claude-code"`, but that portal asset was uploaded as a wide image
and Discord letterboxed it inside the square activity art slot. Schema v4 uses
the square `"large"` portal asset instead.

## Upload checklist

1. Open the app in the Developer Portal:
   <https://discord.com/developers/applications/1466664856261230716/rich-presence/assets>
   (replace the id if you've configured a custom `CC_DISCORD_CLIENT_ID`).
2. Click **Add Image(s)** and upload the files listed below, using the file
   **stem** as the key (Discord lowercases it automatically).

| Asset key       | Source file                                               | Used for                      |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| `large`         | square Claude mascot/logo uploaded in the default app       | `large_image` (main artwork)  |
| `claude-code`   | legacy wide mascot asset                                    | kept for existing custom use   |
| `thinking`      | 512² icon — Claude thinking                               | Small badge when reasoning    |
| `reading`       | 512² icon — file/eye                                      | Small badge when reading      |
| `editing`       | 512² icon — pencil                                        | Small badge when editing      |
| `running`       | 512² icon — terminal                                      | Small badge when running cmd  |
| `waiting`       | 512² icon — hourglass                                     | Small badge when idle-waiting |
| `idle`          | 512² icon — muted                                         | Small badge when idle         |

### Codex apps

Codex uses two Discord applications for the selectable desktop designs. Surface detection remains separate: Pulse labels CLI, VS Code Extension, Codex App, and OpenCode from observed runtime metadata, while the desktop design chooses the application name/artwork shown for a desktop session.

| Design | Client ID | Portal | Asset key | Artwork |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ChatGPT App | `1470480085453770854` | <https://discord.com/developers/applications/1470480085453770854/rich-presence/assets> | `codex-logo` | black ChatGPT knot used by Codex CLI / VS Code Extension |
| Codex App | `1478395304624652345` | <https://discord.com/developers/applications/1478395304624652345/rich-presence/assets> | `codex-app` | blue Codex App artwork |

Reasoning, Standard/Fast speed, and surface are resolved independently from local Codex session/config state. The Discord application title itself must be `ChatGPT App` or `Codex App`; it is not reconstructed as a details line. See [plan-detection.md](plan-detection.md).

## In-app Live Preview art

The Pulse **Discord** view bundles the real Rich Presence artwork locally
(`frontend/src/assets/rp/`, mapped by provider/surface in
`frontend/src/lib/rpArt.ts`) so the Live Preview is faithful **regardless of the
Developer Portal**. This is preview-only; it does not change what Discord
broadcasts, which still depends on the uploads above.

## Fallback tiers (no manual upload required)

If the asset key isn't in the portal, Pulse falls back through three tiers
automatically (`src/discord.rs::resolve_image_ref`):

1. **Key in portal** — the reliable path. Use asset keys uploaded above.
2. **`mp:` prefix** — pass through any pre-computed Discord media reference.
3. **`https://` URL** — wrapped as `mp:external/https/<host>/<path>`, relying
   on Discord's Media Proxy. Works sometimes, not guaranteed.
4. **Raw key** — passed straight to Discord; if the key doesn't exist, Discord
   silently drops the image.

## Diagnosing a missing logo

From the Pulse GUI, open **Settings** → the Discord diagnostic panel shows:
- Which resolution tier is currently active
- Known asset keys fetched from the portal (refreshes every 5 min)
- Suggested fix if the active key isn't in the portal

From the CLI:
```bash
cc-discord-presence doctor
```
Look at `discord_client_id` and the active session's resolved `large_image`.

## Customising assets per user

Users can override any activity key via the config file
(`~/.claude/discord-presence-config.json`):

```jsonc
{
  "display": {
    "large_image_key": "my-custom-logo",
    "activity_small_image_keys": {
      "thinking": "my-thinking-icon",
      "editing": "my-editing-icon"
    }
  }
}
```

Any key you reference must exist in the Developer Portal for the
configured `discord_client_id`.
