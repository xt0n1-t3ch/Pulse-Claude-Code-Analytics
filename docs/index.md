## Models and analytics

| Guide | What it answers |
| --- | --- |
| [Claude models & context](models/claude.md) | Fable/Mythos 5.1, Opus 5, Sonnet 5 and Haiku: API limits, Claude Code windows, prices and implementation gaps |
| [Codex models & context](models/codex.md) | Astra, Sol, Terra and Luna: local Codex capacity, usable budget, API limits, effort and current pricing |
| [Context tracking](guides/context.md) | Current fill, session totals, compaction and source precedence |
| [Cost calculation](guides/costs.md) | Provider-specific token math, price provenance and unknown values |
| [Analysis and recommendations](architecture/analyzers.md) | Cache health, session analysis and supported recommendations |

> **Model reference is not runtime proof.** The Claude and Codex guides separate today's official limits from the local inventory and the bundled catalog. They also list known pricing and context gaps in the implementation.
