# Pulse test suite

Centralized tests for the whole app. Frontend logic/integration/component-render runs on Vitest
(happy-dom); the daemon + analytics core run on `cargo test`. The Vitest config lives in
`frontend/` but the spec tree is rooted here at `tests/`; run both layers before shipping.

## Run

| Layer | Command | What it covers |
|:---|:---|:---|
| Frontend | `bun run --cwd frontend test` | Vitest unit + integration + component render (`tests/unit`, `tests/integration`, `tests/components`) |
| Frontend (watch) | `bun run --cwd frontend test:watch` | Same, watch mode |
| Backend | `cargo test --workspace` | Both Rust crates (`cc-discord-presence` daemon/core + `pulse` Tauri host): inline `#[cfg(test)]` modules + the `tests/*.rs` / `src-tauri/tests/*.rs` integration tests |
| Browser bridge | `cargo test -p pulse --lib dev_bridge` | Loopback-only POST contract, Bearer-token auth, strict local CORS, real command dispatch, safe-control argument guards, and explicit unavailable/unknown behavior |
| Real browser development runtime | `bun run --cwd frontend dev` | Starts Vite plus the authenticated Rust bridge with one generated shared token; `1420` fails closed instead of rendering fixtures when the backend is unavailable |
| Browser Playwright | `bunx --cwd frontend playwright test` | Reuses the authenticated local bridge outside CI, validates proofed-source selection and exact metrics, then verifies the `390px` page width and viewport-bound notification panel |
| Types | `bun run --cwd frontend check` | svelte-check, 0 errors / 0 warnings |
| Codex mirror integrity | `powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/check-codex-rich-presence-upstream.ps1` | Verifies the pinned annotated tag, exact commit, inventory, adapters, and every vendored target hash in `src/codex/UPSTREAM.json`; the scheduled drift job tracks later upstream releases separately |
| Windows polling consoles | `cargo test --locked --test release_scripts vendored_windows_polling_commands_use_silent_launcher -- --exact` | Rejects the old canonical pin and any five-second Git probe that bypasses the shared `CREATE_NO_WINDOW` launcher |
| Provider/metrics fixture contract | `powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/e2e/test-pulse-contract.ps1` | Parses 11 sanitized provider/Discord fixtures plus true-zero/unavailable metrics vectors; checks version/source-contract and cost exactness alignment |
| Pulse E2E harness dry-run | `powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/e2e/run-pulse.ps1 -Mode Browser -DryRun` | Stages temporary homes/DB/provider config and checks the Browser launch prerequisites without starting a server |
| Native Tauri CDP + Playwright E2E | `powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/e2e/run-pulse.ps1 -Mode Tauri -Fixture no_data -RunPlaywright` | Starts owned Vite on `1420` before the repo-owned debug binary; native Tauri alone owns IPC and polling. It isolates WebView2 user data, runs `chromium.connectOverCDP`, validates the no-data Home contract, and cleans only exact owned processes. |

Vitest config: [frontend/vitest.config.ts](../frontend/vitest.config.ts) (alias `@` → `frontend/src`,
`fs.allow` widened to the repo root so the root-level spec tree resolves). Tauri IPC, the event/app/
window/dialog/fs plugins, and Chart.js are all mocked in [tests/setup.ts](setup.ts) so store/view
modules import cleanly outside a WebView; a WAAPI `Element.prototype.animate` stub plus a `matchMedia`
shim let Svelte transitions and media queries run headless. The fake `__TAURI_INTERNALS__.invoke`
routes known list commands, including `get_context_breakdowns`, to `[]`, scalars to stub values, and `get_reports_bundle` to an empty bundle.

## E2E boundary: Vitest, Playwright, Tauri CDP, and Discord IPC

The layers intentionally prove different seams; one green layer is not a
substitute for another:

- **Vitest** (`npm --prefix frontend run test`) owns unit, integration, and
  component rendering against the mocked Tauri bridge. It does not prove a
  real WebView, provider authentication, or Discord IPC.
- **Playwright** (`node tests/visual/verify-responsive.mjs`) owns the browser
  visual matrix against a running URL (`PULSE_VISUAL_URL`, default
  `http://127.0.0.1:1420`). The fixture runner's Browser mode only starts Vite
  and probes `/`; it does not silently claim Playwright or Tauri coverage.
- **Tauri CDP** is available through
  `scripts/e2e/run-pulse.ps1 -Mode Tauri -RunPlaywright` only after a
  repo-owned debug binary exists. The runner starts `bun run dev` from the
  repo-owned `frontend/` directory first because the debug binary's
  `devUrl` is `http://localhost:1420`; it verifies the bridge/Vite listeners
  are descendants of that launcher before starting Pulse. It then uses a fresh WebView2
  remote-debugging port plus an isolated temporary user-data folder (the
  installed Pulse profile is never reused), probes `/json/version`, runs the
  Playwright spec with `chromium.connectOverCDP`, and fails clearly when the
  binary or endpoint is absent; no backend endpoint is guessed.
- **Raw Discord IPC** is available through `-Mode Discord` only with
  `PULSE_DISCORD_LIVE=1`, an already-running Discord desktop process, and a
  proof JSON path. The proof must contain `SET_ACTIVITY` with an activity and a
  clear-activity event. The runner never restarts Discord and does not treat a
  frontend preview as raw IPC evidence.

The provider vectors and expected DTO are documented in
[adaptive-access.md](../docs/architecture/adaptive-access.md). They are
synthetic contract inputs, not live provider snapshots.

| File | Seam | Coverage |
|:---|:---|:---|
| [workspace.spec.ts](../frontend/tests/e2e/browser/workspace.spec.ts) | Browser E2E | proofed provider sources remain separate, unproved API lanes stay hidden, exact metrics remain exact, Home occupies over 96% of the reference viewport, the zero-proof Home contract releases the allowance rail while keeping live work visible, and all primary views are checked at `390px` without page-level overflow |
| [pulse.spec.ts](../frontend/tests/e2e/tauri/pulse.spec.ts) | Tauri CDP E2E | repo-owned WebView renders the current Provider limits/Live workspace Home shell through the real Tauri surface |

The zero-proof rail contract is enforced by the focused Vitest counterpart
`bun run --cwd frontend test -- tests/components/Dashboard.test.ts` and the
browser proof
`bun run --cwd frontend test:e2e -- --grep "Home releases the allowance rail"`.
Home keeps live session telemetry visible while releasing the allowance column
until an authenticated provider route supplies quota proof.

## Frontend — unit (`tests/unit/`)

| File | Module under test | Coverage |
|:---|:---|:---|
| [utils.test.ts](unit/utils.test.ts) | `lib/utils` | `fmtTokens` (B/M/K/unit tiers), `fmtCost` ($ two-decimal), `fmtDuration` (s/m/h+m), `fmtTps` (/s→K/s), `fmtPct` (whole-percent rounding), `usageColor` (normal/warning/danger), `classifyActivity` (thinking/editing/reading/running/waiting/idle), `fmtClock` (HH:MM passthrough + em-dash fallback on null·undefined) |
| [access.test.ts](unit/access.test.ts) | `lib/access` | provider/subscription vs API labels, authenticated-route vs local-history display projections, dynamic provider-native windows, no numeric output for stale or unavailable usage, stable source-id to provider-scope resolution, and no API-to-subscription aliasing |
| [provider.test.ts](unit/provider.test.ts) | `lib/provider` | optimistic latest-intent provider selection, serialized persistence, stale bootstrap rejection, and provider revision publication only for the surviving selection |

## Frontend — integration (`tests/integration/`)

| File | Surface | Coverage |
|:---|:---|:---|
| [tauri-mock.test.ts](integration/tauri-mock.test.ts) | `lib/api` over the mocked Tauri IPC | list commands resolve to `[]`, mapped scalar (`get_active_provider`→`"claude"`), unmapped command resolves to `undefined` without throwing |
| [poll-flow.test.ts](integration/poll-flow.test.ts) | `stores.poll()` → global stores → `Dashboard.svelte` | one `poll()` pass calls each loader exactly once and hydrates `health`/`metrics`/`sessions`/`rateLimits`/`planInfo` + derived `activeSessions`; provider changes synchronously clear proof-bound state and reject prior-provider responses in flight; Dashboard then renders the provider/work shell and two live session cards end to end |
| [phase5-flow.test.ts](integration/phase5-flow.test.ts) | `Reports.svelte` data flow | Reports renders the bundle through a single `getReportsBundle` call |

## Frontend — component render (`tests/components/`)

DOM-render tests for every view/component via `@testing-library/svelte` on happy-dom. Tauri is
satisfied through the injected internals in [setup.ts](setup.ts); the Chart.js view (`Costs`) swaps in
the [fixtures/ChartStub.svelte](fixtures/ChartStub.svelte) stub so canvas-bound charts render headless.

| File | Component | Coverage |
|:---|:---|:---|
| [DesignSystem.test.ts](components/DesignSystem.test.ts) | shared UI contract | canonical neutral dark surfaces, monochrome shell accent, semantic status tokens, Codex-blue provider identity, labeled navigation, coherent primary-view headers/states, flat metric strips, and removal of the Sessions decorative glyph |
| [PulseMark.test.ts](components/PulseMark.test.ts) | `PulseMark` | svg sized to the `size` prop, P-glyph-only when `showPulse` is false (1 path), P glyph + pulse line when true (2 paths) |
| [SessionCard.test.ts](components/SessionCard.test.ts) | `SessionCard` | fast badge present/absent on the `fast` flag, inflated-tokenizer marker shown for opus 4.7+ and Sonnet 5 (sourced from the backend `has_inflated_tokenizer` flag, not a local regex) and omitted for 4.6, Opus 4.8 model display name, Fable/Mythos badges without tokenizer warnings, Sonnet 5 "Intro Pricing" badge presence/absence driven by `session.intro_pricing` |
| [Dashboard.test.ts](components/Dashboard.test.ts) | `Dashboard` (view) | selectable multi-instance focus, exact Context Window fraction, unique session-status rail, flat four-KPI strip, account quota + remaining percentage, and reconciled cost/model data |
| [AccessSourceBar.test.ts](components/AccessSourceBar.test.ts) | `AccessSourceBar` | authenticated subscription/API lanes, local-history-only provider selection, hidden unproved/no-history providers, and separation between analytics scope and the active Discord provider |
| [WorkspaceSurfaces.test.ts](components/WorkspaceSurfaces.test.ts) | `AllowanceRail` + `DataSourceInspector` | honest empty states plus selected-provider allowances without fabricated windows |
| [NotificationCenter.test.ts](components/NotificationCenter.test.ts) | `NotificationCenter` | durable notification loading, unread count, quota-action routing, mark-all-read refresh, last-good preservation on transport failure, stale-response rejection, persistence-failure navigation, and native tray-open events |
| [Sessions.test.ts](components/Sessions.test.ts) | `Sessions` (view) | flat KPI strip labels, live session rows + "2 active", history table loaded from the api layer |
| [Costs.test.ts](components/Costs.test.ts) | `Costs` (view) | Subscription Value Ledger for unavailable money, exact/partial coverage boundaries, token mix/trend, budget cockpit for known spend, Cost-by-Type reconciliation, window-aggregate KPIs, project refetch, and live-snapshot refresh |
| [Heatmap.test.ts](components/Heatmap.test.ts) | `Heatmap` | 24 local-hour cells, total/coverage/peak summaries, proper AM/PM labels, and accessible volume context |
| [VersionContract.test.ts](components/VersionContract.test.ts) | release owners | v1.7.0 synchronization across Cargo, Tauri, frontend, lockfiles, release contract, README, and changelog |
| [UpdateBanner.test.ts](components/UpdateBanner.test.ts) | `UpdateBanner` | automatic update popup, Later/Skip/Open release actions, skipped-version behavior, fake dev update, one explicit Update action followed by signed install and automatic relaunch, retryable failures |
| [Reports.test.ts](components/Reports.test.ts) | `Reports` (view) | coherent analysis header/copy, sections populated from a single bundle call, reload feedback, and cost timeline totals/peaks |
| [Discord.test.ts](components/Discord.test.ts) | `Discord` (view) | coherent Broadcast header, live-preview backend payload, provider capability gates, autosave saving/saved lifecycle, rollback on failed persistence, field reorder/toggles, and theme-aware preview |
| [Settings.test.ts](components/Settings.test.ts) | `Settings` (view) | coherent Application header, identity masthead + config controls, db size + session total, plan override rollback, latest-provider-wins race handling, two-step clear-history confirm, and theme toggle |

## Backend — Rust (`cargo test --workspace`)

Two workspace crates. `cc-discord-presence` (repo root) is the daemon + analytics core;
`pulse` (`src-tauri/`) is the Tauri host that depends on it. `--workspace` runs both crates' inline
`#[cfg(test)]` modules plus the cargo integration tests below. All green.

### Integration tests (`tests/*.rs`, `src-tauri/tests/*.rs`)

| File | Crate | Coverage |
|:---|:---|:---|
| [daemon_e2e.rs](daemon_e2e.rs) | `cc-discord-presence` | end-to-end daemon pipeline over temp JSONL fixtures: Claude session collect accumulates speed-aware per-category cost and reconciles categories to the headline total; tracks last-turn speed/effort/service-tier and builds presence lines (project, "Opus 4.8 (1M)", fast ⚡ marker, effort label); Codex session parses meta/turn-context/token-count, resolves effort/window/totals, and builds presence state (model display, "(Extra High)", fast marker, "Pro 20x ($200/month)") |
| [codex_upstream_contract.rs](codex_upstream_contract.rs) | `cc-discord-presence` | Pulse-facing contract for the mirrored Codex Rich Presence modules: config, cost, display labels, telemetry limits, active-session selection, OpenCode process compatibility, and Windows WSL opt-in/no-window subprocess safety |
| [codex_account_usage.rs](codex_account_usage.rs) | `cc-discord-presence` | canonical `account/rateLimits/read` parsing, coherent global quota + spend Credits, structured `rateLimitResetCredits` preservation, exact used/remaining arithmetic, omission of unreported model scopes, and rejection of empty sparse responses |
| `src/codex/account_usage.rs` unit tests | `cc-discord-presence` | Windows Codex CLI selection prefers the user-local unpackaged binary over an inaccessible AppX path while retaining the desktop GUI rejection guard |
| [access_runtime.rs](../src-tauri/tests/access_runtime.rs) | `pulse` | provider-neutral access routes, local-history capability without authentication promotion, dynamic sparse windows, provider-plan/proof separation, freshness gating, fail-closed mismatched/unknown usage sources, and separate structured Codex reset-credit DTOs |
| [notifications.rs](../src-tauri/tests/notifications.rs) | `pulse` | genuine Codex/Claude reset transitions, timestamp-drift silence, legacy timestamp-only row dismissal migration, provider-health silent baselines, quota deduplication, durable unread/read state, and dismissal filtering |
| [startup_order.rs](../src-tauri/tests/startup_order.rs) | `pulse` | Tauri single-instance registration remains ahead of setup and background-poller startup, so a rejected second launch cannot create another notification/analytics producer |
| [reports_e2e.rs](../src-tauri/tests/reports_e2e.rs) | `pulse` | `build_reports_bundle_from_roots` aggregates fixture traces (user/assistant/tool/mcp/compaction counts, cache health); regression guard that the JSONL tree is scanned exactly once per bundle (no double/8x scan); oversized JSONL over `MAX_JSONL_BYTES` is skipped while small files still trace |
| [report_html.rs](../src-tauri/tests/report_html.rs) | `pulse` | `generate_html_report` / `generate_markdown_report`: writes a sample HTML for `/browser` visual review; offline-safe (no Google Fonts / gstatic / `@import` / `http://`, https only in w3.org+github namespaces); well-formed doctype + single `<html>`, inline `<style>`, inline SVG charts (token-composition aria-label); brand kicker + KPI strip + all eight analyzer section anchors + Speed Split; offline system/monospace font stacks; markdown is non-empty GFM with every section heading + the speed-split table header |

### Inline `#[cfg(test)]` modules

Per-crate, per-module unit tests compiled with each crate. Representative coverage:

| Area | Module | Coverage |
|:---|:---|:---|
| cost / pricing | `src/cost.rs` | per-tier pricing, Fable/Mythos rates, Sonnet 5 introductory/standard pricing across the clock-injected cutoff boundary, digit-boundary-safe Sonnet 5 id classification, cache math, speed-aware totals, 1M-context surcharge, GA no-surcharge table, fast-capable model table |
| presence lines | `src/discord.rs` | Claude presence details/state/tooltip composition across model/effort/speed/marker permutations, including Fable 5 (1M) and Mythos 5 (1M) labels |
| session collect | `src/session.rs` | JSONL parse, token/cost accumulation, reasoning-effort + speed + service-tier extraction, git-branch + parse caching; compaction-boundary detection resets `current_context_tokens` to the real post-compaction size while `max_turn_api_input` (the 1M-tier lifetime peak) survives unchanged, including the missing-`compactMetadata`, compaction-as-first-line, and zero-compaction edge cases |
| metrics / usage | `src/metrics.rs`, `src/usage.rs` | aggregate metrics rollups, plan/usage-window derivation |
| config | `src/config.rs`, `src/codex/config.rs` | presence/pricing config defaults + round-trip + Windows WSL opt-in flag parsing |
| util / process | `src/util.rs`, `src/process_guard.rs` | path/format helpers, single-instance process guard |
| codex core | `src/codex/{session.rs,session/parser.rs,cost.rs,discord.rs,util.rs,process.rs}` | Codex JSONL parse, cost, presence lines, helpers |
| codex telemetry | `src/codex/telemetry/{plan.rs,service_tier.rs,limits.rs}` | provider-scoped exact plan tiers (no Codex Max or generic Pro), service-tier resolution, rate-limit window parsing |
| Windows test harness | `src-tauri/build.rs`, `src-tauri/src/lib.rs` | embeds the shared Common-Controls v6 + Tauri `asInvoker`/`uiAccess=false` manifest; Cargo's current Windows lib harness cannot consume a build-script test-only link flag, so packaged RT_MANIFEST readback remains a release gate |
| db | `src-tauri/src/db.rs` | SQLite historical-session insert/query/round-trip + context snapshot storage clamped to the model window; Codex JSONL collect → upsert → 7d/month forecast integration; inclusive now-6d/exclusive now-8d window boundary; retryable write fingerprints; exact provider isolation plus explicit `all` aggregation; provider history inventory independent of cost/authentication; stored exact/partial/unavailable/provider-billed cost provenance round-trip; Summary, daily, project, hourly, model, and Reports timeline aggregates exclude unavailable raw estimates, average only priced sessions, and expose aggregate coverage |
| analyzers | `src-tauri/src/analyzers/{session_trace.rs,cache_health.rs,model_routing.rs,prompt_complexity.rs,inflection.rs}` | trace scan + scan-pass counting, cache-health grading, provenance-aware model-routing split and inflection detection that cannot promote unavailable raw estimates, prompt-complexity scoring |
| commands | `src-tauri/src/commands.rs` | access snapshots enriched with local-history inventory; reports-bundle assembly from roots; provenance-aware cost totals that retain token categories even when money is unavailable; daily timeline points that exclude unavailable raw estimates and report partial coverage; Codex weekly-only routes are never duplicated into the legacy 5h slot when a model-scoped weekly window is also present; `SessionInfo.intro_pricing`/`has_inflated_tokenizer` wiring for Claude sessions (real-clock, matched against a fresh `cost::active_intro_pricing` call so the test never goes stale across the real cutoff date) and confirmed absent for Codex sessions; `SessionInfo.context_used_tokens` and `build_claude_context_breakdown`'s `used_tokens` reflect current fill (`current_context_tokens`) rather than the historical peak (`max_turn_api_input`), while `context_window_tokens`/the 1M-vs-200K decision still correctly keys off the peak |
| update checks | `src-tauri/src/update_check.rs` | SemVer tag comparison, newer-release detection, prerelease/draft suppression, release URL allowlist |
| browser bridge | `src-tauri/src/dev_bridge.rs` | Debug-only `127.0.0.1:1421` POST transport, Bearer auth, Vite-origin allowlist, bounded request/response transport, validated safe-control arguments, real-command dispatch, and standalone poller seam |

## v1.4.1 targeted validators

Run these before cutting the context-tracking-fix release:

```bash
cargo test --workspace --jobs 2 compact_boundary
cargo test --workspace --jobs 2 current_context_tokens
cargo test -p pulse --lib --jobs 2 reflects_current_fill
npm --prefix frontend run test -- tests/components/Dashboard.test.ts tests/components/Costs.test.ts
npm --prefix frontend run check
```

Live re-proof (not part of the automated suite -- run manually before release): rebuild, relaunch
with `WEBVIEW2_ADDITIONAL_BROWSER_ARGUMENTS=--remote-debugging-port=<port>`, and re-issue the
exact original repro (`window.__TAURI_INTERNALS__.invoke("get_context_breakdown", {sessionId})`
via CDP `Runtime.evaluate`) against the real session that first surfaced the bug; confirm
`used_tokens` is no longer pinned at the stale historical peak.

## v1.4.0 targeted validators

Run these before cutting the Sonnet 5 release:

```bash
cargo test --workspace --jobs 2 sonnet_5
cargo test -p pulse --lib --jobs 2 intro_pricing
npm --prefix frontend run test -- tests/unit/utils.test.ts tests/components/SessionCard.test.ts
npm --prefix frontend run check
```

Full pre-ship gate (see below) applies as usual. Note: this environment compiles the `pulse`
crate's full dependency tree (Tauri + the `icu_properties`/`idna` chain it pulls in) under
tight available memory — pass `--jobs 2` to `cargo` invocations that touch the `pulse` package
or the build can hit `STATUS_COMMIT_LIMIT_EXCEEDED` and cascade into unrelated-looking
compile errors in transitive dependencies. This is an environment/parallelism characteristic,
not a code defect — see the Sonnet 5 handoff for the diagnosis.

## v1.2.0 targeted validators

Run these before cutting the Fable/Mythos + multi-session Context release:

```bash
cargo test --workspace fable mythos
cargo test --workspace presence
npm --prefix frontend run test -- tests/integration/phase5-flow.test.ts tests/components/Discord.test.ts tests/components/SessionCard.test.ts
cargo test -p pulse update_check --lib
cargo test --workspace --test codex_upstream_contract
cargo test --workspace session_used_tokens_uses_context_snapshot_not_lifetime_total
cargo test --workspace wsl_roots_are_explicit_opt_in
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/check-codex-rich-presence-upstream.ps1
npm --prefix frontend run test -- tests/components/UpdateBanner.test.ts
npm --prefix frontend run check
```

Full pre-ship remains:

```bash
cargo fmt --all -- --check
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings
cargo test --workspace
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/check-codex-rich-presence-upstream.ps1
npm --prefix frontend run test
npm --prefix frontend run build
```
